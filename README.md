## Experiments

1. MST
    1. pearson
      * 10k: error rate for 0..10000 samples with different ratios of t-distriburion in mixed distribution
      * mixed ratio: for specified N count error rate for different ratios of t-distribution
    2. signs
      * 5k: for r =0, 0.5, 1; for 0.5000
      * mixed ratio: N=100,1000,3000,5000,10000 for r=0..1 with step 0.1
